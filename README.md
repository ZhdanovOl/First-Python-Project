# Repository for final project
Scenario
I have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, I created an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

Description
In this project, I use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.
Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI-based recommendation systems, automated chatbots, and so on.

In this final project, I have gained knowledge of different aspects of app creation and its web deployment. 

I have acquired the following practical skills:

1. How to Fork and Clone the project repository
2. How to Create an emotion detection application using the Watson NLP library
3. How to Format the output of the application
4. How to Package the application
5. How to Run Unit tests on your application
6. How to Deploy as a web application using Flask
7. How to Incorporate Error handling
8. How to Run static code analysis
